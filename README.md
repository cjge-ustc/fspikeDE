# Fractional Spike Differential Equations Neural Network with Efficient Adjoint Training

These codes implement the methodology proposed in our paper: **Fractional Spike Differential Equations Neural Network with Efficient Adjoint Parameters Training**.

---

## 📌 Core Components
There are four parts of implementations:

1. **DVS128Gesture**  
2. **MNIST**  
3. **Spiking Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (SGCN)**  
4. **MSG_fractional**  

Each component includes dedicated documentation in its subdirectory for execution instructions and experimental configurations.

## 🛠️ Dependencies
Requires Python 3.10+. Install via:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> MSG_fractional parts may need its own dependencies installed, see `MSG_fractional/requirements.txt`.
